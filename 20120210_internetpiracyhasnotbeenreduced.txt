Whatever your stand on internet piracy is, the shutdown of megaupload.com has not affected internet piracy much.  In this post by the Daily Mail, columnist Rob Waugh writes that after the FBI seized megaupload.com and arrested its founder, multimillionaire Kim Dotcom, total internet viewing fell by over two percent.  That is two percent of all of the internet users - about 360 million a day or more than 30% of the whole world.  

Despite the fact that meagupload.com held over 30% of all file-sharing, file-sharing has not dipped by much.  Most of the users of megaupload either moved their business overseas - also displaying the fact that most of them had used oversea based, file-sharing websites, or stitched to other big file-sharing websites like Putlocker, MediaFire and Rapidshire.  This is also shown by their big jump in traffic.

The rest of the article is about Kim Dotcom.  The former hacker was in a New Zealand prison and was denied bail at his bail hearing, on the grounds that he would flee the country if given the chance. This was because it is believed he has access to money, and has a history of fleeing charges.  Dotcom told Auckland court he had no intention of fleeing and would fight for his money, some of which was seized by the authorities. 

I would recommend this article because I found it fascinating.  I would like to see if this has any influence on the Sopa and Pipa issue, and whether it will affect the internet as we know it.
