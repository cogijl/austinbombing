In this commentary in the Washington Post on February 23, columnist Marc A. Thiessen writes about why it is wrong to release a senior Al-Qaeda terrorist named Majid Khan because he made a deal with our government. 

Marc A. Thiessen makes some good points, for example he provides some examples on why Khan should never be released.  Khan has been charged with war crimes, including murder, attempted murder, spying and providing material support for terrorism - with would get him a life sentence twice over.
 
Thiessen states that "Instead [of going to prison], he might now be released.  For what?  Under the reported deal, Khan has agreed to testify against his fellow terrorists during the next four years at Guantanamo, after which he would then be eligible to be transferred to Pakistan."  
 
Thiessen identifies the fact that Majid Khan can and has provided valuable information about members and leaders of the Al-Qaeda, is what has lead the United States to offer Khan this deal.  The information Khan provided did prove useful, and lead to the arrest of a man named Zubair, an operative of Al-Qaeda’s Southeast Asian affiliate Jemmaah Islamiyah.
 
Marc A. Thiessen is a valued columnist at the Washington post, having covered foreign and domestic policy, and contributes to the PostPartisan blog.  He also served as a chief speechwriter to President George W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and before that as a senior aide to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms.  I agree with Mr. Thiessen.  I think that it is just plain dumb to release a terrorist, much less a senior one - no matter what he can provide.
