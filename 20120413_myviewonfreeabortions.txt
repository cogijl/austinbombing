In her post on contraception, Juliana Solitro make the argument that all women should be given "preventative medicine", a.k.a.: abortions, free of charge, regardless of their walk in life.  I disagree.

First, if a women does not want a baby, or is incapable of taking care of one, she should not participate in activities that were made for that reason.

Second, if we are going to give women free abortions, why not give men free condoms, or the like?  Is it not up to the couple to take these preventive measures? 

This is just my view on the subject, but if you can't provide for a child, then don't have sex.
